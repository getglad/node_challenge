# Interview Server

## Overview
This is a NodeJS API server to complement an [Angular front end](https://github.com/getglad/node_challenge_frontend) and Neo4J data store.

The entire project can be installed using the companion [Dockerfile](https://github.com/getglad/node_challenge_dockerfile).

This server was originally generated by the [swagger-codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) project.

Additional classes have been added to allow for communcation with a Neo4J server.

The server has been written in TypeScript.

### Running the server
Be sure to:
  1. `npm install`
  2. Set environmental variables: neo4jURI, neo4jUser, neo4jPassword
    - You can also manually set them in ./neo4j/session

To run the server, run:
```
npm start
```

To build the server from TypeScript into ./dist, run:
```
npm run build
```

To watch for TypeScript changes, run:
```
npm run watch
```

To run Mocha test scripts in ./test, run:
```
npm run test
```

To view the Swagger UI interface:

```
open http://hostname:8080/docs
```

### Project Files Breakdown

The server is broken up into two main folders:
|- ./controllers -> API end points and the related business logic generated by Swagger, with Neo4j queries embeded into them
|- ./neo4j -> Classes to assist in communcation with the Neo4J server

#### ./controllers
It is best to review the Swagger docs at http://hostname:8080/docs to understand the behavior of the API.

The code behind the business logic is fairly straight forward and commented.

#### ./neo4j
|- ./neo4j
|-- ./loader.ts -> Classes to assist in the autopopulation of data into the Neo4J server
|-- ./preload.ts -> Script to load an initial data set into a Neo4J server
|-- ./session.ts -> Class to manage connection and specific query to the Neo4J server
